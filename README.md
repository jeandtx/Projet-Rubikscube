># Projet Report Rubikscube
## Welcome
Welcome 🤗 in our github project ! <br>
You'll find the progression of the code in [commits](https://github.com/jeandtx/Projet-Rubikscube/commits/main).
<br><br>

## The code
The full program 👨‍💻 is divided in only two files:
* The [main.c](https://github.com/jeandtx/Projet-Rubikscube/blob/main/main.c) which create the rubikscube and diplay the user interface
* The [pack.h](https://github.com/jeandtx/Projet-Rubikscube/blob/main/pack.h) which is a header file implement in main.c and who contain all our functions and structure definitions. <br><br>
## Our product

the rubiks cube appears as a colored patron
##### (the orange side will be represented in purple)

On the right side of the patron, a box appears and demands you make a wish 🧚🏽‍♀️<br> 
* Scramble
* Blank
* Fill             
* QuitReset
* pivot front face  
* turn cube horizontaly
* turn cube verticaly

###### *note that the three last functions can be considered as building blocks,<br>from which all other movements of the cube can be created*<br><br>

## Encountered [difficulties](https://github.com/jeandtx/Projet-Rubikscube/issues)
Our first struggles were encountered when attempting to build the function that simply turns the front face.<br>

> ##### Figuring out the allocation of each unit of each face and placing them correctly, as well as determining an algorithm to make this process more efficient, was troublesome. However, our main difficulties were in communication.
<br>

Our disagreements, misunderstandings and imperfect communication sometimes lead to little to no progress in some coding sessions.
<br>
<br>

> ##### However, this prompted us to keep explaining our algorithms, giving us both a better understanding of why our code would or would not work.
<br>

We also tried to produce code to pivot any face, but it appeared that this feat would be much more tedious than expected.
<br>
<br>

> ##### we could not find an universal algorithm (each face turn would have its own function
<br>

A final issue that we encountered were coding together, in viso.. But we closed it quite fast because we knew tools like [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/services/live-share/) on VS code or [github](https://github.com) a version control manager.

## lessons of this project

### In this project, we learned how to : 
* work as a team 🤝
  * ##### we extensively used the liveshare functions of VS code, as well as Discord's screenshares and audio calls.
* use git and github !

  * ##### with numerous commits, pulls & pushes to the main git branch. 
* make algorithms before blindly coding 👨🏽‍🦯
  * ##### by making the mistake, a lot of times. Finally we mastered the use of VS code's whiteboard, allowing us to visualy represent our algorithms.

<br>
<br>

## prospect for improving your project
For the next project:
* We will focus more on algorithms
* make a project schedule and to-do list
* regularly review what we did in regards to our wider endeavor
